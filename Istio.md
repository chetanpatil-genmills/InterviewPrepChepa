Okay, here's the information about managing Ingress Controllers in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) in English:

In Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), you can manage Ingress Controllers using several options, with the most common and recommended approach being through the Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB). Similar to the ALB Controller in AWS, the GCLB Ingress Controller provides load balancing and external access to your Kubernetes cluster.

Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) Ingress Controller:

Automatic Provisioning:

When you deploy an Ingress resource, GKE automatically creates a Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB).

This load balancer routes traffic to the nodes in your cluster.

GKE configures the load balancer based on the rules defined in your Ingress resource.

Layer 7 Load Balancing:

GCLB provides Layer 7 load balancing, which means it can understand and route HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

You can route traffic to different backend services based on hostnames, paths, and other HTTP headers.

SSL/TLS Termination:

GCLB supports SSL/TLS termination, which means you can upload your SSL certificates to Google Cloud, and GCLB will encrypt and decrypt your traffic.

This offloads the burden of encryption and decryption from your backend services.

Multiple Backends:

You can define multiple backend services in a single Ingress resource.

GCLB will route traffic to these backend services based on the rules you define.

Health Checks:

GCLB automatically performs health checks on your backend services.

If a service is unhealthy, GCLB will stop routing traffic to that service.

Global Load Balancing:

If you have GKE clusters in multiple regions, you can use GCLB to set up global load balancing.

GCLB will automatically route your users to the cluster closest to them.

How to Manage the Ingress Controller:

Define Ingress Resource:

Define your Ingress resource in a YAML file.

In this file, you need to define your hostnames, paths, and backend services.

Deploy Ingress Resource:

Deploy your Ingress resource using the command kubectl apply -f my-ingress.yaml.

Check GCLB:

In the Google Cloud Console, you can check the status and configuration of your GCLB.

Alternative Ingress Controllers:

Besides GCLB, you can also use other Ingress Controllers, such as:

NGINX Ingress Controller: This is a popular open-source Ingress Controller based on the NGINX web server.

HAProxy Ingress Controller: This is based on the HAProxy load balancer.

These Ingress Controllers need to be installed and configured manually, but they offer more flexibility and customization options compared to GCLB.

Summary:

The easiest and recommended way to manage Ingress Controllers in GKE is to use the Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB). GCLB automatically provides load balancing and external access for your Kubernetes cluster. If you need more flexibility and customization, you can use other Ingress Controllers, such as NGINX Ingress Controller or HAProxy Ingress Controller.



Okay, here's a simplified diagram illustrating how the Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB) Ingress Controller works in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE):

Explanation of the Diagram:

Internet: Represents external users accessing your application.

Google Cloud Load Balancer (GCLB):

This is the entry point for external traffic.

It receives HTTP/HTTPS requests from the internet.

It uses the rules defined in your Ingress resource to determine where to route the traffic.  These rules can be based on hostnames, paths, or other HTTP headers.

It performs SSL/TLS termination if configured.

GKE Cluster (Multiple Nodes):

Your Kubernetes cluster consists of multiple nodes.

The GCLB distributes traffic across these nodes.

Pods (Backend Services):

Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, typically running your application code.

The GCLB routes traffic to the appropriate pods based on the Ingress rules and service definitions.

Key Concepts Illustrated:

External Access: The GCLB provides a single, stable entry point for external traffic to access your application running in GKE.

Load Balancing: The GCLB distributes traffic across multiple nodes and pods, ensuring high availability and performance.

Ingress Rules: The Ingress resource defines the rules that the GCLB uses to route traffic.

Service Discovery: The GCLB integrates with Kubernetes services to discover the backend pods that should receive traffic.

In summary, the GCLB acts as a reverse proxy and load balancer, sitting in front of your GKE cluster and routing external traffic to the appropriate backend services based on the rules you define in your Ingress resource. This simplifies external access, provides load balancing, and enhances the overall reliability and scalability of your application.

Explanation of the Diagram:

Internet: Represents external users accessing your application.
AWS Load Balancer (ALB/NLB - Optional):
Optional: You might use an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) or Network Load Balancer (NLB) to provide a stable entry point and load balancing for the Istio Ingress Gateway. This is common for production deployments.
ALB: Suitable for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, providing Layer 7 routing capabilities.
NLB: Suitable for TCP/UDP traffic, providing Layer 4 load balancing with high performance.
If you skip this, you can expose the Istio Ingress Gateway directly using a Kubernetes Service of type LoadBalancer, but this is less common in production.
EKS Cluster (Control Plane & Worker Nodes):
Your Kubernetes cluster managed by EKS.
The Control Plane manages the cluster.
Worker Nodes are where your application pods run.
Istio Control Plane (e.g., istiod):
The brain of Istio. istiod is a unified control plane component that manages and configures the data plane proxies (Envoy).
It's responsible for:
Service Discovery: Learning about the services running in your cluster.
Configuration: Distributing traffic management rules, security policies, and other configurations to the Envoy proxies.
Certificate Management: Providing certificates for mutual TLS (mTLS).
Istio Ingress Gateway (Envoy):
An Envoy proxy deployed as a Kubernetes service.
It acts as the entry point for external traffic into the service mesh.
It performs:
Traffic Routing: Routing traffic to the appropriate services based on Istio's routing rules (VirtualServices, Gateway resources).
Authentication and Authorization: Enforcing security policies.
TLS Termination: Handling TLS encryption/decryption.
Services (with Sidecar Proxy):
Your microservices running in the EKS cluster.
Sidecar Proxy (Envoy): Each service instance (pod) has an Envoy proxy injected as a sidecar container. This is the core of the Istio data plane.
The sidecar proxy intercepts all inbound and outbound traffic for the service.
It enforces the policies configured by the Istio control plane.
Pods (Application Code):
The actual application code running within the pods. The application is unaware of the Istio sidecar proxy.
Key Concepts Illustrated:

Service Mesh: Istio creates a service mesh by injecting Envoy proxies as sidecars into your pods. This allows you to manage traffic, security, and observability across your services in a consistent way.
Traffic Management: Istio provides rich traffic management features, including:
Routing: Fine-grained control over how traffic is routed between services (e.g., based on headers, weights, etc.).
Traffic Shifting: Gradually rolling out new versions of services.
Fault Injection: Testing the resilience of your application by injecting faults (e.g., delays, errors).
Security: Istio provides strong security features, including:
Mutual TLS (mTLS): Encrypting all traffic within the service mesh.
Authentication and Authorization: Controlling which services can access other services.
Observability: Istio provides detailed observability data, including:
Metrics: Collecting metrics about service performance.
Distributed Tracing: Tracing requests as they flow through the service mesh.
Logging: Collecting logs from the Envoy proxies.
Ingress Control: The Istio Ingress Gateway manages external access to the services within the mesh.
In summary, Istio on EKS provides a powerful platform for managing microservices. It allows you to abstract away the complexities of traffic management, security, and observability, enabling you to focus on building and deploying your applications. The AWS Load Balancer (ALB/NLB) provides a stable entry point, the Istio Ingress Gateway manages external access, the Istio control plane configures the data plane, and the Envoy sidecar proxies enforce policies and provide observability for each service.
